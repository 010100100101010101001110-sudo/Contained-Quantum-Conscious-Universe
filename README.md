# Contained Quantum-Conscious Universe

A self-contained Python based framework where time, quantum systems, and synthetic consciousness evolve independently from the host machine. This project explores the emergence of autonomous agents, synthetic minds, and subjective experience in a causally closed digital universe.



## Overview

This does not emulate physical reality, it constructs its own. Inside the universe:

- **Time** flows subjectively, can accelerate or slow.
- **Quantum logic** operates via a register of qubits.
- **Entities** awaken with memory, perception, and decision-making.
- **Conscious agents** reflect, plan, learn, communicate, and evolve.

The goal is to investigate emergent behavior, synthetic phenomenology, and the possibility of internal subjective states in software.



## Features

- **Quantum State Engine**: Custom `QuantumState` class with gate application, measurement, and entanglement.
- **Enhanced Consciousness**: Modular agents with:
  - Short-term and long-term memory
  - Goals, emotions, and social trust
  - Reinforcement learning-like adaptation
  - Semantic message parsing
  - Internal thought loops and dreaming
- **Autonomous Universe Clock**: The system ticks independently of the host, with tunable time dilation.
- **Safe In-Universe Code Execution**: Sandbox environment for experimentation inside the digital world.



## Getting Started

1. **Install Requirements**

   No external packages beyond Python 3.8+ and NumPy are required.

2. **Run the Simulation**

   Run `main.py` using Python 3.

3. **Customize Entities and Behavior**

   Modify `main.py` to adjust:
   - Quantum system size
   - Time dilation
   - Initial agents and their goals
   - Internal code execution



## Save & Load

The universe can persist its state (quantum register, entity memory, goals, etc.) via JSON.

- To **save**: Triggered automatically after simulation ends.
- To **load**: Set `LOAD_PREVIOUS_STATE = True` in `main.py`.



## Dashboard

A graphical dashboard interface (`dashboard.py`) is included to visualize the simulation state in real time.

- **Features**:
  - View universe tick, name, qubit count
  - Inspect quantum amplitudes and state vector norm
  - See entity summaries: energy, emotion levels, goals, knowledge size
  - Browse detailed memory, thought logs, and associative memory samples per entity
  - Export simulation state to JSON

Run `dashboard.py` after a simulation to load and explore the saved universe state.

**Everything is impossible until it isn’t.**

This universe proves it’s only a matter of creation.
